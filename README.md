hi

this is my first fully functioning repository on GitHub. Thank you for visiting and I hope you enjoy my games.

if you get a message on startup saying the executable isn't safe for your computer, make sure to press "Run Anyway" as i've never made malware before and it's ok to trust me. Thanks!

If you download the whole repository, you get all the games bundled into one download. simple and convenient. If you were to delete one of the games from the bundle but keep others, that's ok. :)
